## 3.1.0

### Patch Changes

- 82137ab: Relicense the core bot library and infrastructure packages from AGPL-3.0-only to GPL-3.0-only; first-party addons in lumi-addons remain AGPL-3.0-only. GPLv3 §13 / AGPLv3 §13 explicitly permit combining GPL and AGPL-licensed works, so third-party addons can keep depending on and importing the core SDK surface across the license boundary.
- 146c469: Fix broadcast consumer groups replaying the full stream backlog on every restart (groups now start from `$` for broadcast subscriptions instead of `0`), stop acking a message when its DLQ write fails (so a dead-letter failure no longer silently loses the message), and guard `runClaim`'s `pendingDeliveryCount` call with try/catch so a transient Redis error doesn't kill the claim loop.

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- 70337e8: Remove the split gateway/worker topology; the worker now owns its own Discord
  Gateway connection.

  `apps/gateway` relayed raw Discord dispatch packets to workers over Redis
  Streams, and the worker replayed them into discord.js's internal
  `client.ws.handlePacket()`. That method assumes single-process invariants, which
  the relay could not satisfy: interaction pre-acknowledgement state was lost,
  `client.application` was unset when Sapphire registered slash commands, and two
  WebSocket sessions competed for one bot token.

  **Breaking changes:**

  - `apps/gateway` is deleted. Remove any `LUMI_ROLE=gateway` process from your
    deployment; the worker replaces it entirely.
  - `LUMI_ROLE` accepts only `worker` (default) and `scheduler`. The `monolith`
    and `gateway` roles are gone - `monolith` is now simply `worker`.
  - `RawGatewayPublisher`, `RawGatewayConsumer`, and the `RawGatewayEnvelope` /
    `rawGatewayStream` contracts are removed from `@lumi/event-bus` and
    `@lumi/contracts`.
  - `INTERACTION_DEFER_AT_GATEWAY` is removed; interactions are always deferred
    in-process.
  - Kubernetes: `gateway-statefulset.yaml` and `worker-scaledobject.yaml` are
    removed, and the worker deployment becomes a StatefulSet - it now holds real
    per-shard state, so replica count is a shard-assignment decision rather than a
    queue-lag autoscaler target.

  `@lumi/sharding` is now wired into the worker: with `CLUSTER_NAME` set, replicas
  divide the shard count from `GET /gateway/bot` between themselves, throttle
  IDENTIFY through Redis, and resume persisted sessions across restarts. Command
  registration against Discord's REST routes is gated behind a Redis leader lock
  so only one replica performs it per boot. Multi-replica deployments should set
  `DISCORD_PROXY_URL` to a shared `nirn-proxy` so REST rate-limit buckets stay
  coordinated. The task queue, scheduler RPC, and dashboard RabbitMQ RPC paths are
  unchanged.

### Minor Changes

- 4b2b884: New `security` module with a Wick-style anti-nuke detector: watches audit-log entries for mass bans, kicks, channel/role deletions, and webhook creation, counts per-executor actions in a sliding Redis window, and responds with automatic quarantine, ban, or a logged alert (guild owner, the bot, and configured trusted roles are exempt). Quarantine and mod-log helpers move to `#lib/moderation` for cross-module reuse. The worker ships the GuildModeration, GuildInvites, and GuildWebhooks intents so audit-log, ban, role, webhook, and invite dispatches reach the module.

### Patch Changes

- 5d96c1b: Bug-fix batch from an architecture review: symlink install no longer crashes on a dangling target; `ping`/`telemetryStats` clean up their intervals and REST listeners on unload; `InvalidationBus` now does a full resync when its Redis subscriber reconnects after a dropped connection, and `ModuleStore`/`TempVcRegistry` consume it; cache invalidation gets a delayed double-delete to close the stale-write race; sharding's `reconcileAssignment` re-reads the assignment after acquiring the leader lock to close a split-brain window; `ClusterReadyTracker` is now per-replica instead of a single global key; `RedisSessionStore.flush()` restores unflushed entries on a failed pipeline instead of losing them; `RedisIdentifyThrottler` no longer sleeps 250ms when a bucket lock is already free; dashboard RPC mutation handlers re-validate the actor's live Discord permissions instead of trusting the (up to 8h stale) session; the RabbitMQ RPC bridge nacks malformed messages and always replies on handler failure instead of leaving the dashboard caller to time out, and the dashboard RPC client no longer leaks its timer/listener on a synchronous send failure; `RedisStreamsBus` still acks a poison message if publishing it to the DLQ fails, instead of retrying it forever; `GuildWriteTransaction`'s `Symbol.dispose` logs release failures instead of swallowing them; `SecurityService`'s anti-nuke/raid rate limiters increment and set their TTL atomically, and `grantVerified` swaps roles in one call instead of leaving a member stuck with both roles if the second call fails.
- a453146: Fix Head-Of-Line socket blocking in RedisStreamsBus by executing non-blocking xautoclaim on publisher connection instead of blocking subscriber connection.
